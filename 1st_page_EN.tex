I tried many jobs in my life, but, surprisingly even to myself,
the job I'm proud of is rewriting large piece(s) of compiled code back to C/C++.
This is extremely boring and slow process, I once spent more than a year on rewriting 100KB DLL to pure C,
and it was like full-time job.
And this is also expensive.

By the way, a lot of tricks has been added to this book during this work.

Probably, such service could be interesting to those who inherited some compiled code with no source code.

I have an idea to replace all OllyDbg examples in the book by examples using some other debugger.
I have nothing against OllyDbg, but it has GUI and uses small fonts, and screenshots are somewhat unsuitable for the book.
Maybe I would use GDB, rada.re or WinDbg.
Or maybe some other console debugger?

What do you think about it?
Should I leave OllyDbg examples, or GDB examples would be OK?
