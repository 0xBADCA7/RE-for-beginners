I have an idea to replace all OllyDbg examples in the book by examples using some other debugger.
I have nothing against OllyDbg, but it has GUI and uses small fonts, and screenshots are somewhat unsuitable for the book.
Maybe I would use GDB, rada.re or WinDbg.
Or maybe some other console debugger?

What do you think about it?
Should I leave OllyDbg examples, or GDB examples would be OK?
