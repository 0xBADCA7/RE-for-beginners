I tried many jobs in my life, but, surprisingly even to myself,
the job I'm proud of is rewriting large piece(s) of compiled code back to C/C++.
This is extremely boring and slow process, I once spent more than a year on rewriting 100KB DLL to pure C,
and it was like full-time job.
And this is also expensive.

By the way, a lot of tricks has been added to this book during this work.

Probably, such service could be interesting to those who inherited some compiled code with no source code.

You must be a legal owner of the software product.

I could also try (binary) code audit.
I can try to find vulnerabilities in your software, before others will do it.
This is like penetration testing.
I can try to work with binary code without source code.

You must also be a legal owner of the software product.

I have an idea to replace all OllyDbg examples in the book by examples using some other debugger.
I have nothing against OllyDbg, but it has GUI and uses small fonts, and screenshots are somewhat unsuitable for the book.
Maybe I would use GDB, radare or WinDbg.
Or maybe some other console debugger?

What do you think about it?
Should I leave OllyDbg examples, or radare examples would be OK?
