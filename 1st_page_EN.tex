The book you currently see is \href{http://beginners.re/}{free} and is \href{https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/}{available in open source form}.
But sometimes I need to do something for money, so sorry in advance for placing my advertisement right here.

\Large Reverse engineering \normalsize

I tried many jobs in my life, but, surprisingly even to myself, the job I'm proud of is rewriting large piece(s) of compiled code back to C/C++.
This is extremely boring and slow process, I once spent more than a year on rewriting 100KB DLL to pure C, and it was like full-time job.
Probably, this could be interesting to those who inherited some compiled code with no source code.
And this is also expensive.
